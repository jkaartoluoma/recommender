# E-commerce recommendation system in Google Cloud Platform
Recommender Systems [TIETS43](https://coursepages.uta.fi/tiets43/) Project work.

Training and deploying this recommendation system requires the following applications from Google Cloud Platform.
* [Compute Engine](https://cloud.google.com/compute/)
* [Cloud Storage](https://cloud.google.com/storage/)
* [App Engine](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/)

Your project must have [Billing](https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/) and all the necessary [APIs](https://cloud.google.com/apis/) mentioned above enabled to run the recommender system in GCP.


## Installation
Following steps are needed only at the first time. If you have done the installation before jump to step **Usage**.

### Install Miniconda 2:

    bash Miniconda2-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh

### Install the Python packages and TensorFlow:

    cd recommendation-system
    conda create -n tfrec
    conda install -n tfrec --file conda.txt
    source activate tfrec
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    pip install tensorflow==1.4.1

## Usage

### Initialization
If you have performed the **Installation** step before then you only need to do the following steps:

    cd recommendation-system

    source activate tfrec

### Assing the Cloud Storage Bucket
App needs a Cloud Storage Bucket to deploy the model and to load the data.

Assign the following environment variable:

    export BUCKET=gs://recserve_$(gcloud config get-value project 2> /dev/null)

If you have not created a bucket for your code to run in then run the following.

    gsutil mb ${BUCKET}

### Training the model

Go to the wals_ml_engine folder and train the model. 

    cd wals_ml_engine

    ./mltrain.sh local $BUCKET/data/recommendation_events.csv \
    --use-optimized --output-dir ${BUCKET} 

1. First parameter in ./mltrain.sh defines where you want to train the model (here it's set to local). 
2. Second parameter is the path where the training data is located.
3. **--use-optimized** uses already hypertuned parameters for the training.
4. **--output-dir** defines the output directory where the model is saved. 


### Deploying the model

Go to the scripts folder and prepare the app for deployment.

    ./prepare_deploy_app.sh


Every time you want to deploy a new version to the Google App Engine run the following command.

    gcloud -q app deploy ../app/app_template.yaml_deploy.yaml
